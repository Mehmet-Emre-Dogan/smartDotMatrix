Multi-purpose dot matrix device
The project has been already finished when the repository was opened. However, I wanted refactor and cite the code before uplading to here. Morevover, I also wanted to add some more features and refurbish the webpage project hosts. Therefore, since I could not find a time to do these jobs, I am unable to upload the source code.
